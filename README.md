# FungiScope

Welcome to the Fungal Skin Infection Detector repository! This project represents a collaborative effort to develop an advanced detector for fungal skin infections using deep learning techniques in Python. The project leadership, dataset creation, and technical proficiency contribute to a robust and accurate model for detecting skin infections.

## Features

Led a collaborative team effort of four members from ideation to implementation, ensuring effective communication and coordination throughout the development of the fungal skin infection detector.

Curated a comprehensive dataset for model training, combining 1,640 images from the DERMNET dataset, 228 images from MSLD, and 550 images from diverse internet sources. This meticulously crafted dataset forms the foundation for robust and accurate model training.

Demonstrated strong technical skills in deep learning and Python programming to develop an efficient and accurate fungal skin infection detector. Implemented state-of-the-art algorithms, leveraging the created dataset to achieve high-quality model predictions.
